# Discrete-Time-Simulation

Programs that make calculations on user-inputted parameters to solve projectile problems of many variations


Resistance Simulation uses discrete-time simulation with user-inputted differential element magnitude and drag constant to do a step-by-step simulation of projectile firing under the effect of air resistance.

Targeting Requirement uses the Intermediate Value Theorem in calculus before using bisection to calculate the required velocity (given an angle) and the required angle (given a velocity) needed to hit a specified target.

Projectile Calculation uses recursive functions to algebraically calculate the destination of a projectile.
