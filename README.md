# Projectile Simulations

Resistance Simulation uses discrete-time simulation with user-inputted differential element magnitude and drag constant to do a step-by-step simulation of projectile firing under the effect of air resistance.

Targeting Requirement.cpp uses the intermediate value theorum and bisection along with recursive functions, user-inputted command-line parameters, and error checking to calculate the required angle (given a velocity) and required velocity (given an angle) for a projectile of mass m to hit location (d,t) from (0, h) (with other parameters taken into account such as target building width and height)
